## Draft User Stories
### Visitor Experience
1.  As a **Visitor**, I want to enter my zip code on the homepage, so that I can see events happening specifically in my neighborhood.
2.  As a **Visitor**, I want to browse upcoming events sorted chronologically for a given zip code without needing to sign up, so that I can explore what the app offers easily.
3.  As a **Visitor**, I want event cards to show the event title, type, and date/time, so that I can quickly scan for relevant activities.
4.  As a **Visitor**, I want to see an attendee count (and perhaps generic icons) on event cards, so that I can gauge event popularity before deciding to learn more or sign up.
5.  As a **Visitor**, I want to click an event card to view its full details (description, location info), so that I have enough information to decide if I'm interested.
6.  As a **Visitor**, I want clear prompts to sign up or log in when trying to access features like RSVPing, so that I understand the benefits of creating an account.
7.  As a **Visitor**, I want to see a message if there are no events listed for my zip code, so that I know the area is available for new postings.
### Neighbor (Registered User) Experience
8.  As a **Neighbor**, I want to create an account with my username, password, and zip code, so that I can fully participate by creating events and RSVPing.
9.  As a **Neighbor**, upon logging in, I want to automatically see the event feed for my registered zip code, so that I don't have to enter it every time.
10. As a **Neighbor**, I want to create a new event posting for my zip code (including title, description, time, location type) via a modal pop-up, so that I can easily organize and announce local gatherings without leaving the main feed. *(Supports Custom Feature: Modal Pop-up)*
11. As a **Neighbor**, I want the system to validate my event submission (e.g., ensure the date is in the future and required fields are filled), so that event postings are accurate and useful. *(Supports Custom Feature: Backend Validation)*
12. As a **Neighbor**, I want to click an "I'm Going!" (RSVP) button on an event's detail page, so that I can signal my attendance and connect with others going.
13. As a **Neighbor**, I want to see the usernames (or avatars) of other neighbors attending an event on the detail page, so that I know who to expect and feel more connected to my community.
14. As a **Neighbor**, I want to be able to edit the details of events that I have created, so that I can correct errors or update information.
15. As a **Neighbor**, I want to be able to delete events that I have created, so that I can remove cancelled or outdated postings.
16. As a **Neighbor**, I want to view a separate "My Events" page listing all the events I have RSVP'd to, so that I can easily keep track of my upcoming plans.
