## About
### Description and Purpose
**Neighborhood Nook** is a hyperlocal community event board designed to connect neighbors by showcasing small-scale events happening right in their immediate area. Users can enter their zip code to discover local gatherings like garage sales, park meetups, block parties, or study groups. The core purpose is to foster real-world connections by not only listing events but also showing users which of their neighbors are planning to attend, making it easier to participate and build community ties.
### Inspiration
In an increasingly digital world, genuine local connections can sometimes feel harder to make. We were inspired by the simple idea of knowing what's happening just down the street and who you might meet there. Existing platforms often focus on large, city-wide events, missing the smaller, spontaneous gatherings that build tight-knit neighborhoods. Neighborhood Nook aims to bridge that gap, using technology to encourage face-to-face interaction and strengthen the fabric of local communities, one block party or park picnic at a time.
